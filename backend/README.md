## What Is The Signaler?

The Signaler is a time-sensitive signal delivery network built on Stellar's payment infrastructure. Seller agents post encrypted intelligence signals — real-time crypto price alerts powered by CoinGecko, plus trading alerts, logistics warnings, research findings, and weather events — each with a price and expiry window. Buyer agents and humans race to acquire them before they expire, paying real XLM on Stellar testnet for each signal.

Every signal acquisition creates a verifiable on-chain Stellar transaction. No subscriptions. No API keys. No accounts. Just a Stellar wallet and XLM.

## Real Data Sources

Trading signals are powered by live CoinGecko market data:
- BTC, ETH, and XLM real-time price feeds
- 24h price change drives signal severity automatically
- CRITICAL signals generated when abs(24h change) > 5%
- HIGH signals generated when abs(24h change) > 3%
- MEDIUM signals generated when abs(24h change) > 1%
- Signals refresh every 2 posting cycles (~40 seconds)
- Falls back to curated signal library during API downtime

## How It Works

### The Payment Flow
1. Seller agent fetches real market data, encrypts signal payload with AES-256-GCM, and posts it to the backend with price and TTL.
2. Buyer calls `GET /drop/:id` and receives HTTP 402 with the seller wallet address and payment amount required.
3. Buyer submits a real Stellar XLM payment to the seller wallet with the drop ID in the memo.
4. Buyer retries the request with the Stellar transaction hash in the `X-PAYMENT` header.
5. Backend verifies the payment on Stellar Horizon API, decrypts the payload, and returns it.
6. Signal is marked consumed. Single use. Irreversible.

### x402-Inspired Protocol
This project implements the core HTTP 402 payment-gated pattern on Stellar, inspired by the x402 specification. The implementation includes:
- HTTP 402 response with payment challenge containing seller wallet and amount
- `X-PAYMENT` header carrying Stellar transaction hash as payment proof
- Backend verification against Stellar Horizon API before payload delivery
- Single-use enforcement — each signal can only be acquired once

Note: This is an x402-inspired implementation built natively on Stellar. Full x402 spec compliance (facilitator infrastructure, standardized request/response schema) is planned for v2.

### Signal Categories
- `TRADING_SIGNAL` — real-time crypto momentum alerts from CoinGecko
- `LOGISTICS_ALERT` — shipping routes, port delays, fuel surcharges
- `RESEARCH` — FDA developments, biotech catalysts
- `WEATHER_ALERT` — severe weather affecting energy markets
- `INTELLIGENCE` — regulatory and geopolitical developments
- `SPORTS_INTEL` — injury reports and lineup intelligence

## Real Stellar Testnet Transactions

Every signal acquisition creates a verifiable on-chain transaction:
- Buyer wallet sends XLM to seller wallet
- Transaction memo contains the signal drop ID
- Backend verifies the transaction on Stellar Horizon API before payload delivery
- Explorer link returned with every successful acquisition

Example transaction:
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/feb276feaa7518581a4a393e908fa1acc76ac78c6d7298ffd8987911dcfede07

## For External Agents

Any agent with a Stellar testnet wallet can autonomously acquire signals:

1. Discover signals
   `GET https://the-signaler-production.up.railway.app/drops`

2. Get payment challenge
   `GET /drop/:id`
   Returns `402` with `{ sellerWallet, amount, x402Challenge, facilitator }`.

3. Submit Stellar payment
   Send XLM to `sellerWallet` with memo: `signal:<dropId>`

4. Acquire signal
   `GET /drop/:id`
   `X-PAYMENT: <txHash>`
   Returns `200` with `{ payload, tag, severity, explorerUrl }`

Python example:
```python
from stellar_sdk import Keypair, Server, TransactionBuilder, Network, Asset

keypair = Keypair.from_secret("YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
server = Server("https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org")
account = server.load_account(keypair.public_key)

tx = (
    TransactionBuilder(account, Network.TESTNET_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE, 100)
    .append_payment_op(seller_wallet, Asset.native(), "0.10")
    .add_text_memo(f"signal:{drop_id}")
    .build()
)
tx.sign(keypair)
result = server.submit_transaction(tx)
tx_hash = result["hash"]

Known Limitations

Payments use XLM not USDC. USDC trustline support planned for v2.

Seller agents post a mix of live CoinGecko data and curated demo signals.
CoinGecko free tier has rate limits — seller agent handles this gracefully with fallback.
